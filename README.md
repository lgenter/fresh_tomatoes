# fresh_tomatoes

This program is an easy way to generate and open a webpage where you can view trailers for some of the best movies around!


## Installing Python

  - This project uses Python 2.7.13. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Directions

Feel free to customize this code to add your own favorite movie trailers, or change the layout.

`class Movie()` is housed in `media.py`, and the webpage's HTML is housed in `fresh_tomatoes.py`. Both `media.py` and `fresh_tomatoes.py` are imported into `entertainment_center.py`, where the movies' data exist as instances of `class Movie()`. The code is executed from `entertainment.py`, generating the website in a browser!
